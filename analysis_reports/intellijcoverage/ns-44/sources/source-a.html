&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Interface for classes judging whether a victory occurred or not. These
&nbsp; * classes may not modify game state. Reporting must be done via the given
&nbsp; * interface. classes also should not have any nasty internal state outside
&nbsp; * methods this will guarantee them to act _only_ based on gamestate The only
&nbsp; * case where this should be done is in cases where you have to count occurances
&nbsp; * of some action or duration of something. In this case the information should
&nbsp; * be stored in the context-object NOTE: if you delegate from one victory-class
&nbsp; * instance to other, they must be created in similar fashion (ie. constructed
&nbsp; * at the same time and destroyed at the same time) to guarantee proper working
&nbsp; * also , if you delegate, you should delegate each time to guarantee that
&nbsp; * victorypoint-counting and duration-counting implementations get access to
&nbsp; * game state every round. NOTE2: calling victory 1 time or n times per round
&nbsp; * should not make a difference! victories counting rounds must not assume that
&nbsp; * they are called only once per round NOTE3: dont even think about making
&nbsp; * different victoryclasses communicate straight or via context-object ;) NOTE4:
&nbsp; * victories should take into account in their reporting (adding reports to the
&nbsp; * result-object) that their results might be filtered. So the reports should be
&nbsp; * mostly of the &quot;what is the score&quot; -type (player A occupies the victory
&nbsp; * location) or fact-type (Player A has destroyed player B&#39;s commander)
